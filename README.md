# HarshvardhanPatil27-Employee_Salary_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
This project predicts employee salaries based on factors like job title, experience level, company size, remote work ratio, and location. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contains 130k+ records.
Data preprocessing includes one-hot encoding, log transformation of salaries, and train-test splitting.
An Improved Random Forest Regressor model was used for prediction, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ~₹45,000 and R² score of ~0.26.
The project is built using Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib, and includes performance visualization.
This project was done as part of the AI/ML Internship by Edunet in collaboration with Microsoft.
